The given infrastructure is an AWS environment defined using Terraform. It includes the following resources:

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): A default VPC named "Sample-VPC" with DNS support and hostnames enabled. The CIDR block for the VPC is defined by the variable var.vpc_cidr_block.

Subnets: Four subnets, two public and two private, each with a unique CIDR block, all within the same VPC. The public subnets are in the "eu-west-3a" availability zone, while the private subnets are in the "eu-west-3b" availability zone.

NAT Gateways: Two NAT gateways, one for each public subnet, providing outbound internet access for instances in the private subnets.

Route Tables: Two public and two private route tables, each associated with the respective subnets.

Network ACLs: Two network ACLs for the public subnets, allowing inbound and outbound traffic from any IP address.

Internet Gateway: An internet gateway attached to the VPC.

Security Group: A security group for instances in the private subnet.

Elastic IPs: Two Elastic IPs associated with the NAT gateways.

Kinesis Stream: A Kinesis Data Stream with a single shard.

IAM Roles: Two IAM roles, one for a Lambda function and another for a Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream.

IAM Policies and Attachments: Several IAM policies and attachments that grant the necessary permissions to the Lambda function and the Firehose Delivery Stream.

CloudWatch Log Group: A CloudWatch Log Group for Firehose logs.

Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream: A Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream that reads data from the Kinesis Data Stream and stores it in an S3 bucket.

S3 Bucket: An S3 bucket with server-side encryption enabled, used as the destination for the Firehose Delivery Stream.

Lambda Function: A Lambda function written in Python 3.9, which has access to the Kinesis Data Stream and the Firehose Delivery Stream.

Kinesis Stream Consumer: A Kinesis Stream Consumer that allows multiple applications to consume data from the Kinesis Data Stream.

Overall, this infrastructure creates a data processing pipeline using a Kinesis Data Stream, a Lambda function, and a Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream to store the processed data in an S3 bucket. The VPC, subnets, and network components provide a secure and isolated environment for the resources.
